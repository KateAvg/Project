# Project
Hello! This is a small, unfinished project I had in mind for a while.
It's about a website for a Car Workshop that the clients are able to visit through any device and book a reservation, and the Owner is able to visit also and be able see the reservations.

If you wanna try to open it, open first Xampp and activate Apache and MySQL.
Then save this repository in htdocs file in the Xampp folder at your C:/ disk or wherever you have it installed.
Later type localhost/Project/database.php at your browser, in order to create the database.
After you done all those things, write at your browser: localhost/project in order to open the homepage.

I would like a feedback! Thank you!

Still in progress: 1. Login/Register buttons and database for the informations at those pages.
                   2.Create the database for the login/register file.
                   3. Use more CSS in order to be the page more professional.
